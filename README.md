# Portfolio
This repository showcases my computational chemistry, biophysics, and materials science work, focusing on molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory calculations. These projects demonstrate my broad range of capabilities, transferable to any molecular system, from biomolecules and drug discovery to materials design and surface interactions.
Feel free to contact me for collaborations or inquiries.

## Advanced Molecular Dynamics & Computational Biophysics Projects:

- Explored dynamic behavior of biomolecules under varying conditions such as temperature, and salt concentration with AMBER, NAMD, and GROMACS.
- Conducted conformational search for proteins and ligands to identify stable binding poses and explore energy landscapes.
- Analyzed ligand binding energies with DNA and protein molecules, helping predict molecular interaction strength and specificity.
- Simulated DNA nanopore systems and DNA origami structures to investigate their potential in biosensing applications.
- Utilized Python with MD simulation tools (e.g., AMBER, GROMACS) and custom scripts to prepare systems, run simulations, and process data.
- Optimized simulation parameters to improve computational efficiency and ensure high-quality results in large-scale systems.
